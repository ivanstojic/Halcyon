ABOUT

This is Halcyon. A simple, no nonsense PHP microframework that aims to
help you kickstart your web development.

There are several goals to this project:

1) Provide absolutely top-notch documentation and a codebase small
enough for *anyone* to understand.

2) Enable simple, easy and fast prototyping of web applications in PHP

3) Integrate softly with ORM libraries for automatic form generation.



DEPENDENCIES

The framework currently has only one absolutely required dependency:
the RunKit PECL extension.



HANDLERS

Requests (both GET and POST) are handled by methods implemented in
separate source files, which must be implemented within a class called
Handler.

See examples, or the app/ directory in the default distribution.



URL-TO-FILE DISPATCHING

Here's an example of how Halcyon attempts to match URLs into
class/method/parameters:

Given an URL http://somewhere/halcyondir/foo/bar/baz/quux here is the
list of attempted methods and parameters
